During my graduate studies, I focused on the application of artificial intelligence, with particular interests in signal processing and image processing. Throughout this period, I actively engaged in multiple projects and research endeavors related to artificial intelligence, exploring advanced algorithms and technologies to address real-world challenges. I contributed to the development of deep learning-based signal processing methods aimed at enhancing and clarifying sensor data, thereby improving data usability and quality. Additionally, I conducted research on deep learning-based image processing techniques aimed at enhancing image resolution, reducing noise, and achieving more accurate object detection and recognition. Through these studies, I deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence technologies, accumulated extensive practical experience, and laid a solid foundation for future explorations in this field.
